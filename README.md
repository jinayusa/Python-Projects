# Fullstack AI Project with Django

This project demonstrates a full-stack Django web application that integrates API call visualization, data cleaning, chatbot functionality, AI predictions, and self-learning algorithms. The project follows the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and includes a proper UI, full-stack integration, and well-designed directory structure.

## Features

- **API Call Visualization**: Fetches data from an external API and visualizes it using charts.
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleans incoming data (removes missing values, filters out invalid entries).
- **Chatbot**: Implements a simple AI-driven chatbot that provides responses based on user input.
- **AI Predictions**: Uses AI (Linear Regression) to predict BMI based on user input such as height and weight.
- **Self-learning Algorithm**: A self-learning algorithm that allows the AI model to improve over time by retraining itself with new data.
- **Full-Stack Integration**: Django backend with HTML templates for UI and interactive elements.
- **SDLC**: Follows the full software development life cycle, including planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Web framework for backend.
- **Python**: Programming language for backend logic.
- **Numpy**: Library for numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for AI predictions.
- **Requests**: Library for making HTTP requests to external APIs.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for visualizing data with charts.
